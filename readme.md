non professional. coding. enthusiast. web dev, enjoying the beauty of algorithms, forms and dataprocessing. lately adding devops to my fancy buzzword-list.

i think i do cool stuff, but there isn't anyone to tell me otherwise anyway. beside being called html-programmer by non-programmers.

longing for serious feedback to improve any of my frameworks, code quality and practices.
